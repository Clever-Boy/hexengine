HTML5 Game Engine

=========

Hex Engine is a 2d HTML5 game engine.

This game engine represents my 3rd generation of game engine experience. It uses advanced rendering techniques
to squeeze large amounts of rendering, such as high resolution lighting, into a web browser.

=========

This game engine is not 100% complete as the level design tools are only about 90% complete. Once the level design
tools are complete, I will call the engine itself complete.

=========

You are free to use any part of this engine you see fit so long as you give me credit. I require comments in your code
as well as a name in your credits if you have them. Other than that, use this technology as you see fit :)

ALSO, Please do send me an email so I can follow your project if you use hex or its tech! shawndeprey@gmail.com
